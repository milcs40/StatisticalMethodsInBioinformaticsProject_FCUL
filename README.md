# Statistical Methods in Bioinformatics Project @FCUL
Individual Project for the Statistical Methods in Bioinformatics Course @FCUL - 

In this project, the student should choose different packages from Bioconductor, and perform transcriptomic analysis of a given dataset, considering the following taks:
- Make a report containing the description of the statistical methodology that appears in the paper which is the basis for the chosen package;
- Apply the selected package to a data set, which can be (1) a dataset available on the web or other packages, own data, etc. or (2) simulated data.

The final project includes:
- [Results report](MiguelCasanova_MEB_Question2.pdf)
- [The count table for the dataset used](YuviaUnique_genes_gencode.rarR)
- [A R script with the code for the analysis](MiguelCasanova_MEB_Question2_Rscript.R)
- [List of differentialy expressed genes (DEGs)](MiguelCasanova_MEB_Question2_DEGTables.xlsx)
